## Spaced Repetition Your Way
<hr />

### Random To-Dos:
* Make a more generic button component that receives a value prop because I swap button values a lot, no need to have multiple
* Eventually swap over to react-bootstrap instead of using it the normal way
* Figure out a way to only run the dueForStudy function once, instead of running it again when the "Study All" button is clicked (will probably require shufflings methods around in components)
* Learn and add Redux for managing all my state changes; this might also help with the task above and clean up my component code
* Maybe add a timer to the study function so that if they cant get the right answer in a certain amount of time it moves on
